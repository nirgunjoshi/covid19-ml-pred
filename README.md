<h1> COVID-19 Prediction using Machine Learning</h1>

<h2>Project Goal and Purpose:</h2
</h4>The goal of this project is to predict the outbreak trend in the world and in the US using Machine Learning

We will model the global and US trajectories of the outbreak counts of confirmed cases,deaths and recovered cases from the start date of 22 January 2020 to now and predict 10 days in the future

Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

Tableau is used to do the Map Analysis, Total Analysis and Forecast Analysis

<h5>Tableau is used to do the Map Analysis, Total Analysis and Forecast Analysis
<li>1. Map Analysis: Map box is used to create the Map Analysis </li>

<li>2. Total Analysis: World Measures:This gives the various measures from individual countries for active, confirmed, deaths, recovered cases</li>

<li>3. Forecast Analysis: * Forecasting in Tableau uses a technique known as exponential smoothing. </li>
<li>* Uncover underlying structure;Forecast algorithms try to find a regular pattern in measures that can be continued into the future. </li>
<li> * All forecast algorithms are simple models of a real-world data generating process (DGP).</li>

## Requirements

### Python

To run the app, you need to install flask, sqlAlchemy, sklearn and pickle.
<br>

### How to run

In terminal, <br>
`conda activate PythonData` <br>
then start the server by typing `python app.py`<br>
Open the web browser and redirect to your server `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

### Heroku

A compiled version of the app can be found on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home) at:
